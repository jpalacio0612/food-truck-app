# Food Truck App

Welcome to the Food Truck App project! This is web application build in React and Material-UI that allows users to view a list of food trucks and their details, as well as add comments to each food truck. The app also includes a search feature that allows users to search for food trucks by name.

## Why React and Material-UI?

I chose to build this app using React and Material-UI because I wanted to create a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Material-UI is a set of React components that implement Google's Material Design guidelines. Together, React and Material-UI make it easy to create a beautiful and functional web application.

## Why not Next.js in this case?

Even though I have experience with Next.js and I know the benefits of server-side-rendering, In this case I chose React because I wanted to build a simple, client-side-rendered application that focuses on the front-end user interface.

## Features

- View a list of food trucks with their details, including name, menu, and location.
- Add comments to each food truck.
- Search for food trucks by name.
- Infinite scroll to load more food trucks as the user scrolls down the page.

## Thinks I would like to improve or add with more time

- Add more features to the app, such as user authentication, user profiles, and the ability to add food trucks to the list.
- Improve the design of the app by adding more styling and animations.
- Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure the app is working correctly.
- Add End-to-End tests using Cypress.
